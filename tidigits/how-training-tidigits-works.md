title: How To Train TIDIGITS
---

#Introduction
TIDigits is a comparatively simple connected digits recognition task.
Like many well-known corpia, Kaldi includes a example script for it.
It is fairly typical for the example scripts.

The dataset 


##The Three Major Steps

There are Three Steps to applying Kaldi to a task such as this.

1. Data Preparation:

   * Locating the datafiles
   * Parsing its annotations (eg Speaker Labels, Utterance Labels)
   * Converting the audio data format
2. Language Preparation:

   * Creating a Language Model in OpenFST
3. Training/Evaluating the Speach Recogniser:

   * This is the only step that is actually done in Kali proper, rather than by helper scripts and tools.
   * Viewing the results is also nontrivial
   * Kaldi does not store results in the most clear way,
